Resi-Fit “Where U Hustle for Your Last Name”
The app that gauges your adeptness and overall financial stability in the establishment of residual income. In the words of the Late “Nipsey Hustle”, “You aren’t on a real bag if it isn’t Mailbox money’! Our App fills in the gap through gauging their financial literacy and their ability to allocate small amounts of money towards assets that provide monthly, quarterly, and annual dividend payments. Our target audience is people between the ages of 16-65, no one is too young or too old to learn how to develop residual income for themselves or for their families. 
Far Vision: The end-state for this application is to foster a developmental environment where anyone of all ages can learn how to strategically invest for their future through the medium of residual income. The average American only learns about and how to invest their hard-earned income through a traditional 401k; this must change. Instead of being reliant upon a jobs ability to invest your money, you can learn the small nuclei of the stock market and invest after learning each mediums capability. 
Strategic investors have a greater likelihood of achieving their goals due to structured and refined plans prior to ever entering the market. This what makes them successful, THEY ARENT LOOKING TO GET RICH QUICKLY!! They understand building financial stability takes time and consistency. Our overall goal is to reach 100 million individuals who will successfully gauge their abilities and successfully institute their plan to reach self-identified financial goals. 
Near Vision: Our immediate objective is to gain a clear perspective of the relative information needs of our stakeholders in respect to their financial goals. Due to the fluid dynamics of service members lives and college student lives we understand attention to detail is key and fluidity of information is essential. Our engagements w/ stakeholders will enable us to gain a clear picture of our product backlog requirements. This information will garner the attraction of future constituents whom will observe the value in our service and actively participate within the platform. 
It is estimated we will have nearly 1000 participants or greater prior to actual product launch due to our organizations access to our target audience. 
Version 1.0 is focused upon ease of use, timely and accurate information from external financial sources (i.e. Tradingview, Yahoo Finance) internal Income calculators to accurately gauge the finance sectors economically suitable for our clients. Regardless of their economic status our app will provide focused outlines of target achievable investment opportunities and provide continuous tracking of our client’s goals through metrics-based outputs. These will be provided internally within the app.
