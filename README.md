Resi-Fit “Where U Hustle for Your Last Name”
The app that gauges your adeptness and overall financial stability in the establishment of residual income. In the words of the Late “Nipsey Hustle”, “You aren’t on a real bag if it isn’t Mailbox money’! Our App fills in the gap through gauging their financial literacy and their ability to allocate small amounts of money towards assets that provide monthly, quarterly, and annual dividend payments. Our target audience is people between the ages of 16-65; no one is too young or too old to learn how to develop residual income for themselves or for their families. 


Far Vision: The end-state for this application is to foster a developmental environment where anyone of all ages can learn how to strategically invest for their future through the medium of residual income. The average American only learns about and how to invest their hard-earned income through a traditional 401k; this must change. Instead of being reliant upon a jobs ability to invest your money, you can learn the small nuclei of the stock market and invest after learning each mediums capability. 
Strategic investors have a greater likelihood of achieving their goals due to structured and refined plans prior to ever entering the market. This what makes them successful, THEY ARENT LOOKING TO GET RICH QUICKLY!! They understand building financial stability takes time and consistency. Our overall goal is to reach 100 million individuals who will successfully gauge their abilities and successfully institute their plan to reach self-identified financial goals. 


Near Vision: Our immediate objective is to gain a clear perspective of the relative information needs of our stakeholders in respect to their financial goals. Due to the fluid dynamics of service members lives and college student lives we understand attention to detail is key and fluidity of information is essential. Our engagements w/ stakeholders will enable us to gain a clear picture of our product backlog requirements. This information will garner the attraction of future constituents whom will observe the value in our service and actively participate within the platform. 


It is estimated we will have nearly 1000 participants or greater prior to actual product launch due to our organizations access to our target audience. 
Version 1.0 is focused upon ease of use, timely and accurate information from external financial sources (i.e. Tradingview, Yahoo Finance) internal Income calculators to accurately gauge the finance sectors economically suitable for our clients. Regardless of their economic status our app will provide focused outlines of target achievable investment opportunities and provide continuous tracking of our client’s goals through metrics-based outputs. These will be provided internally within the app. 


Stakeholder User Stories
Terrell Skinner: Executive Director and Founder of The Skinner Foundation
https://www.houseofskinnercorp.org/
He is owner of a Non-Profit seeking to expand upon teaching financial literacy. His organization is presently working with the Pinnellas County School district to bring a financial literacy program to its students. He is also a US Army Veteran who recognizes the importance of this information and its impact for service members, and the rigors of the lifestyle. 

Needs:  
-	Classes on how to read the market. Present different options for long term investment other than 401k 
-	Some kind of protection plan in case the market ain’t doing well. At that SES level folks are more concerned about how to survive. 
-	Understanding finances is the first pillar, this can be done through the app by just simple giving the user a financial construct on how they should budget. Letting them adjust as appropriate while also giving explanations as to why something is a good idea vs a bad idea (obviously based on their income) I think the podcasting would work well with familiar faces that look like them endorsing the app that will also help with buy in.
-	Access to reading material that will break down different strategies (also a glossary with words I should know) (Definitely a High Priority, easy dictionary development/function)
-	Access to be able to have live chats with advisors. (Based upon API connectivity – Medium Priority – May require additional Resources)

Stake Holder User Story 3:


Inky Matthews


College Student at The University of Alabama


A Science and Technology major, working towards opening her own Mechanical Bio-Science business; has always wanted a greater and more detailed explanation toward investing. While there are a number of venues she’s been approached by, she has yet to find one that truly educates its users in simplistic fashion. College students have minimal capital to work with, and an extreme tool toward paying off student loans faster can be executed through investing. Investing is how she was able to shift the financial outlook and opinion of members within her family. 

Needs:
-	An app that finds enables students to find the sweet spot for folks to thrive while working through renewing their mind not just in literacy but how to structure their finances.
-	Some kind of protection plan in case the market isn’t doing well. (A lack of financial acumen raises this concern, an app that teaches students how to hedge against market decline. 
-	Quarterly newsletter about different tips and how informative maybe a weekly podcast can be influential in their growth and educational experience (you bring on different people you learned from) as another resource for folks who aren’t big readers to listen.
-	Long Term: Incentives to invest more money I.e., if I invest x amount I will get a credit to buy more stock. 
-	An app with a strong social media recognition, cultural relativity and something that centralizes itself around college life and working towards our future goals. A social culture that fosters a dream building environment. 


Product Backlog (Ordered)

Rationale - the backlog has been ordred, for the most, according to most essential application functionality to have a minimum functioning product. Only the developers took part in estimating the time to complete the PBIs. Whole team relative size estimating was also done to help gauge the difficulty of each item in relation to another by using the Affinitiy Method of relative sizing. 

Below is a link to our backlog but you will not be able to access it unless we approve you as a user. Thus, we've put a sample of the backlog here to give an idea of what we're working on.

SPRINT 1

Forecast Number of Story Points to Be Completed - 5
Rationale - Using what we learned from class, we know that humans tend to be overly optimistic when estiamting how muych work they can complete in a given time frame (guilty!). Given this information, we fell we have chosen a very achievable amount of work for our first sprint. Further, we know that we can adjsut for future sprints with techniques such as "Yesterday's Weather". We can use this technique to set our sprint forecast for sprint two based on what we were able to accomplish in sprint one. *Only developers participated in the sprint planning.
